reactor-cpp
===========

reactor-cpp is a framework for writing reactor-oriented programs.  While
reactor-cpp can be used as a standalone framework, it is designed to work in
conjunction with `Lingua Franca <https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca>`_, a
polyglot coordination language. Have a look at the Lingua Franca
`wiki <https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki>`_ to get an overview of the
reactor model.
